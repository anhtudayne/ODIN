    <p style="color:blue;font-size:200%;">Good, old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns. Perfect with hot pepper sauce and ketchup!</p>
    <ul style="color:blue;font-size:150%;">Ingredients</ul>
    <ul>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</ul>
    <ul>Â½ medium onion, finely chopped</ul>
    <ul>1 large egg</ul>
    <ul>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.</li>
        <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer.
             Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
        <li>
            Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece,
            it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. 
            Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
